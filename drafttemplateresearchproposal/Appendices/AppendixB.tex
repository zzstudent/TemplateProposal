\section{What this Template Includes}

\subsection{Folders}

This template comes as a single zip file that expands out to several files and folders. The folder names are mostly self-explanatory:

\keyword{Appendices} -- this is the folder where you put the appendices. Each appendix should go into its own separate \file{.tex} file. An example and template are included in the directory.

\keyword{Chapters} -- this is the folder where you put the thesis chapters. Each chapter should go in its own separate \file{.tex} file.

\keyword{Figures} -- this folder contains all figures for the thesis. These are the final images that will go into the thesis document.

\subsection{Files}

Included are also several files, most of them are plain text and you can see their contents in a text editor. After initial compilation, you will see that more auxiliary files are created by \LaTeX{} or BibTeX and which you don't need to delete or worry about:

\keyword{example.bib} -- this is an important file that contains all the bibliographic information and references that you will be citing in the thesis for use with BibTeX. You can write it manually, but there are reference manager programs available that will create and manage it for you. Bibliographies in \LaTeX{} are a large subject and you may need to read about BibTeX before starting with this. Many modern reference managers will allow you to export your references in BibTeX format which greatly eases the amount of work you have to do.

\keyword{MastersDoctoralThesis.cls} -- this is an important file. It is the class file that tells \LaTeX{} how to format the thesis. 

\keyword{main.pdf} -- this is your beautifully typeset thesis (in the PDF file format) created by \LaTeX{}. It is supplied in the PDF with the template and after you compile the template you should get an identical version.

\keyword{main.tex} -- this is an important file. This is the file that you tell \LaTeX{} to compile to produce your thesis as a PDF file. It contains the framework and constructs that tell \LaTeX{} how to layout the thesis. It is heavily commented so you can read exactly what each line of code does and why it is there. After you put your own information into the \emph{THESIS INFORMATION} block -- you have now started your thesis!

Files that are \emph{not} included, but are created by \LaTeX{} as auxiliary files include:

\keyword{main.aux} -- this is an auxiliary file generated by \LaTeX{}, if it is deleted \LaTeX{} simply regenerates it when you run the main \file{.tex} file.

\keyword{main.bbl} -- this is an auxiliary file generated by BibTeX, if it is deleted, BibTeX simply regenerates it when you run the \file{main.aux} file. Whereas the \file{.bib} file contains all the references you have, this \file{.bbl} file contains the references you have actually cited in the thesis and is used to build the bibliography section of the thesis.

\keyword{main.blg} -- this is an auxiliary file generated by BibTeX, if it is deleted BibTeX simply regenerates it when you run the main \file{.aux} file.

\keyword{main.lof} -- this is an auxiliary file generated by \LaTeX{}, if it is deleted \LaTeX{} simply regenerates it when you run the main \file{.tex} file. It tells \LaTeX{} how to build the \emph{List of Figures} section.

\keyword{main.log} -- this is an auxiliary file generated by \LaTeX{}, if it is deleted \LaTeX{} simply regenerates it when you run the main \file{.tex} file. It contains messages from \LaTeX{}, if you receive errors and warnings from \LaTeX{}, they will be in this \file{.log} file.

\keyword{main.lot} -- this is an auxiliary file generated by \LaTeX{}, if it is deleted \LaTeX{} simply regenerates it when you run the main \file{.tex} file. It tells \LaTeX{} how to build the \emph{List of Tables} section.

\keyword{main.out} -- this is an auxiliary file generated by \LaTeX{}, if it is deleted \LaTeX{} simply regenerates it when you run the main \file{.tex} file.

So from this long list, only the files with the \file{.bib}, \file{.cls} and \file{.tex} extensions are the most important ones. The other auxiliary files can be ignored or deleted as \LaTeX{} and BibTeX will regenerate them.

\section{Filling in Your Information in the \file{main.tex} File}\label{FillingFile}

You will need to personalise the thesis template and make it your own by filling in your own information. This is done by editing the \file{main.tex} file in a text editor or your favourite LaTeX environment.

Open the file and scroll down to the third large block titled \emph{THESIS INFORMATION} where you can see the entries for \emph{University Name}, \emph{Department Name}, etc \ldots

Fill out the information about yourself and institution. You can also insert web links, if you do, make sure you use the full URL, including the \code{http://} for this. If you don't want these to be linked, simply remove the \verb|\href{url}{name}| and only leave the name.

When you have done this, save the file and recompile \code{main.tex}. All the information you filled in should now be in the PDF, complete with web links. You can now begin your thesis proper!

\section{Thesis Features and Conventions}\label{ThesisConventions}

To get the best out of this template, there are a few conventions that you may want to follow.

One of the most important (and most difficult) things to keep track of in such a long document as a thesis is consistency. Using certain conventions and ways of doing things (such as using a Todo list) makes the job easier. Of course, all of these are optional and you can adopt your own method.

\subsection{References}

The \code{biblatex} package is used to format the bibliography and inserts references such as this one \parencite{Reference1}. The options used in the \file{main.tex} file mean that the in-text citations of references are formatted with the author(s) listed with the date of the publication. Multiple references are separated by semicolons (e.g. \parencite{Reference2, Reference1}) and references with more than three authors only show the first author with \emph{et al.} indicating there are more authors (e.g. \parencite{Reference3}). This is done automatically for you. To see how you use references, have a look at the \file{Chapter1.tex} source file. Many reference managers allow you to simply drag the reference into the document as you type.

Scientific references should come \emph{before} the punctuation mark if there is one (such as a comma or period). The same goes for footnotes\footnote{Such as this footnote, here down at the bottom of the page.}. You can change this but the most important thing is to keep the convention consistent throughout the thesis. Footnotes themselves should be full, descriptive sentences (beginning with a capital letter and ending with a full stop). The APA6 states: \enquote{Footnote numbers should be superscripted, [...], following any punctuation mark except a dash.} The Chicago manual of style states: \enquote{A note number should be placed at the end of a sentence or clause. The number follows any punctuation mark except the dash, which it precedes. It follows a closing parenthesis.}

The bibliography is typeset with references listed in alphabetical order by the first author's last name. This is similar to the APA referencing style. To see how \LaTeX{} typesets the bibliography, have a look at the very end of this document (or just click on the reference number links in in-text citations).

\subsubsection{A Note on bibtex}

The bibtex backend used in the template by default does not correctly handle unicode character encoding (i.e. "international" characters). You may see a warning about this in the compilation log and, if your references contain unicode characters, they may not show up correctly or at all. The solution to this is to use the biber backend instead of the outdated bibtex backend. This is done by finding this in \file{main.tex}: \option{backend=bibtex} and changing it to \option{backend=biber}. You will then need to delete all auxiliary BibTeX files and navigate to the template directory in your terminal (command prompt). Once there, simply type \code{biber main} and biber will compile your bibliography. You can then compile \file{main.tex} as normal and your bibliography will be updated. An alternative is to set up your LaTeX editor to compile with biber instead of bibtex, see \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/154751/biblatex-with-biber-configuring-my-editor-to-avoid-undefined-citations/}{here} for how to do this for various editors.

\subsection{Tables}

Tables are an important way of displaying your results, below is an example table which was generated with this code:

{\small
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}
\caption{The effects of treatments X and Y on the four groups studied.}
\label{tab:treatments}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
\toprule
\tabhead{Groups} & \tabhead{Treatment X} & \tabhead{Treatment Y} \\
\midrule
1 & 0.2 & 0.8\\
2 & 0.17 & 0.7\\
3 & 0.24 & 0.75\\
4 & 0.68 & 0.3\\
\bottomrule\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}
}

\begin{table}
\caption{The effects of treatments X and Y on the four groups studied.}
\label{tab:treatments}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
\toprule
\tabhead{Groups} & \tabhead{Treatment X} & \tabhead{Treatment Y} \\
\midrule
1 & 0.2 & 0.8\\
2 & 0.17 & 0.7\\
3 & 0.24 & 0.75\\
4 & 0.68 & 0.3\\
\bottomrule\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

You can reference tables with \verb|\ref{<label>}| where the label is defined within the table environment. See \file{Chapter1.tex} for an example of the label and citation (e.g. Table~\ref{tab:treatments}).

\subsection{Figures}

There will hopefully be many figures in your thesis (that should be placed in the \emph{Figures} folder). The way to insert figures into your thesis is to use a code template like this:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Figures/Electron}
\decoRule
\caption[An Electron]{An electron (artist's impression).}
\label{fig:Electron}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
Also look in the source file. Putting this code into the source file produces the picture of the electron that you can see in the figure below.

\begin{figure}[th]
\centering
\includegraphics{Figures/Electron}
\decoRule
\caption[An Electron]{An electron (artist's impression).}
\label{fig:Electron}
\end{figure}

Sometimes figures don't always appear where you write them in the source. The placement depends on how much space there is on the page for the figure. Sometimes there is not enough room to fit a figure directly where it should go (in relation to the text) and so \LaTeX{} puts it at the top of the next page. Positioning figures is the job of \LaTeX{} and so you should only worry about making them look good!

Figures usually should have captions just in case you need to refer to them (such as in Figure~\ref{fig:Electron}). The \verb|\caption| command contains two parts, the first part, inside the square brackets is the title that will appear in the \emph{List of Figures}, and so should be short. The second part in the curly brackets should contain the longer and more descriptive caption text.

The \verb|\decoRule| command is optional and simply puts an aesthetic horizontal line below the image. If you do this for one image, do it for all of them.

\LaTeX{} is capable of using images in pdf, jpg and png format.

\subsection{Typesetting mathematics}

If your thesis is going to contain heavy mathematical content, be sure that \LaTeX{} will make it look beautiful, even though it won't be able to solve the equations for you.

The \enquote{Not So Short Introduction to \LaTeX} (available on \href{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf}{CTAN}) should tell you everything you need to know for most cases of typesetting mathematics. If you need more information, a much more thorough mathematical guide is available from the AMS called, \enquote{A Short Math Guide to \LaTeX} and can be downloaded from:
\url{ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/short-math-guide.pdf}

There are many different \LaTeX{} symbols to remember, luckily you can find the most common symbols in \href{http://ctan.org/pkg/comprehensive}{The Comprehensive \LaTeX~Symbol List}.

You can write an equation, which is automatically given an equation number by \LaTeX{} like this:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
E = mc^{2}
\label{eqn:Einstein}
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}

This will produce Einstein's famous energy-matter equivalence equation:
\begin{equation}
E = mc^{2}
\label{eqn:Einstein}
\end{equation}

All equations you write (which are not in the middle of paragraph text) are automatically given equation numbers by \LaTeX{}. If you don't want a particular equation numbered, use the unnumbered form:
\begin{verbatim}
\[ a^{2}=4 \]
\end{verbatim}
